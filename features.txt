Classes
    Troglodyte
        unarmed attack - (need to be facing in right direciton? Perhaps highlight viable tiles while unarmed?)
        Light level always 1
        Eat monsters?
            When you use an unarmed attack on a corpse, chance to gain nourishment
            tiny monsters drop as edible items
    Lightfoot -
        extra luck (or chance to keep luck on use)
        less health/stamina/inventory?
    Brute - 
        More max stamina/health
        Can't move diagonally backwards

Injuries
    Chance of injury on damage. chance increases with damage dealt, decreases with current health.
        Leg - chance to lose turn when moving
        Arm - chance to lose turn when rotating
        Body - chance to lose turn when resting
        Head - chance to take different action when moving
    Different options from different damage types?
        Artery - chance to lose health each turn unless bandaged?
    Perhaps all damage types do leg, arm, body, head. Then each type has a special injury as well. Concussion for blunt, artery for edged. 


Spawn village?
    add wild animals with 1-5% spawn chance
    edit map save on exit to decrease goblin spawn chance and increase wild animal spawn chance

Monster update
    chaseNatural - remember last place spotted player. If player out of los, treat that spot as target. Forget when reach target.
    chaseBinary - move in direction of player each turn. Optionally need los.
    chaseBinary monsters should usually have a slow value. Maybe even have it increase when they take damage. (skeleton, zombie)
    chasebinary monsters with no slow value and decent health will be very scary

Cartography tools
    Use to 'record' a percentage of tiles you can see. Just records if there is wall or floor.
    See recorded walls/floors outside of view as faded image
    minimap that shows recorded portions of current map?
