    <h2>Inspirations</h2>
    <a href = 'https://caravelgames.com/Articles/Games_2/GatEB.html' target="_blank"><h3>DROD</h3></a>
    <p>Solidus was, first and foremost, inspired by DROD (Deadly Rooms Of Death).</p>
    <p>DROD captivated me as a child, and then again during covid when I discovered GatEB. I was enthralled by the tactical, positional combat which was unlike anything I'd seen anywhere else. My mind wandered to what else the Q/W/Numpad control scheme could achieve, and the seeds of Solidus were planted.</p>
    <p>If you enjoy the chess-like, puzzle elements of Solidus you should absolutely give DROD a try.</p>

    <a href="https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/" target="_blank"><h3>Dwarf Fortress</h3></a>
    <p>Dwarf Fortress gave me a pie-in-the-sky vision of what a team of one or two passionate people can achieve on a project like this.</p>
    <p>The boundlessly expanding complexity of DF's systems, its level of immersion despite limited graphics, and the dedication of its creators to keep the game free-to-play have all been big inspirations. It's continued to be a reminder that a game doesn't have to be polished and accessible for it be to beloved.</p>
    <p>Give Dwarf Fortress a try if you want to push the bounds of what it means to "play" a game.</p>
